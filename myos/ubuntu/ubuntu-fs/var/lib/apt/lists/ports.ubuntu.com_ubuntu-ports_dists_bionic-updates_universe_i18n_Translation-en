Description-en: metapackage for the BOINC client and the manager
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 This package depends both on the BOINC core client program that is
 required to participate in any project that uses BOINC, and the
 BOINC Manager, a graphical monitor and control utility for the
 BOINC core client.

 .
 This package contains the BOINC core client program that is required
 to participate in any project that uses BOINC. A central server
 distributes work units and collects results via this client. When
 attaching a local machine to a project, this client will also
 dynamically download the scientific data and executables to be then
 wrapped by the BOINC core client.

Package: boinc-manager
Description-md5: 18cdf3bcfd01c25a71225cc0291571cd
Description-en: GUI to control and monitor the BOINC core client
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing using volunteered computer
 resources.
 .
 This package contains the BOINC Manager, a graphical monitor and
 control utility for the BOINC core client. It gives a detailed
 overview of the state of the client it is monitoring, as there are
  * attached projects
  * running tasks
  * file transfers between the client and project servers
  * statistics about granted credits and disk usage for every project
  * constraints on CPU usage
 The BOINC Manager has two modes of operation, the "Simple View" in which
 it only displays the most important information and the "Advanced View"
 in which all information and all control elements are available.
 .
 For active participation in any BOINC project the recommended
 boinc-client package, not the boinc-manager, is required for every
 machine contributing.

 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 The BOINC client is configurable by the command line or the BOINC
 manager's GUI to compute with any range between 0% and 100% of
 available resources, and to change that ratio to a higher after
 some user determined duration of inactivity. There is now quite
 a number of individuals who prefer to have everything presented
 with their accustomed principle for setting and choosing a screen
 saver. Upon inactivity, the BOINC client is started, and stopped
 again when the user is back. To save the screen, it then shows
 the graphical progress indication as optionally shown also by
 the manager.
 .
 This package is excellent to further promote BOINC, recalling the
 effect SETI@Home once had in the Cambridge, UK, CB2 Cybercafe.
 Just, when using it together with the regular BOINC client setup,
 it is suggested not to have all CPUs used to avoid multiple
 processes running on the same core.

 This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install
 symlinks for any of the supported utilities. Some of the utilities
 can be used in the system by installing the busybox-syslogd,
 busybox-udhcpc or busybox-udhcpd packages.

Package: busybox-syslogd
Description-md5: 6d204aacbcadc9711030ab99f904ca3b
Description-en: Provides syslogd and klogd using busybox
 The system log daemon is responsible for providing logging of
 messages received from programs and facilities on the local host as
 well as from remote hosts.
 .
 The kernel log daemon listens to kernel message sources and is
 responsible for prioritizing and processing operating system
 messages.
 .
 The busybox implementation of the syslogd is particular useful on
 embedded, diskless (netboot) or flash disk based systems because it
 can use a fixed size ring buffer for logging instead of saving logs
 to the disk or sending it to remote logging servers. The ring buffer
 can be read using the (also busybox based) command logread.
 .
 This package provides the glue to the busybox syslogd and klogd to be
 used in the system by providing the appropriate symbolic links and
 scripts.

Package: cloud-initramfs-growroot
Description-md5: 2a0d4bed7bada9873cf69d658abe0c23
Description-en: automatically resize the root partition on first boot
 This package adds functionality to an initramfs built by initramfs-tools.
 When installed, the initramfs will repartition a disk to make the
 root volume consume all space that follows it.
 .
 You most likely do not want this package unless you know what you are
 doing.  It is primarily interesting in a virtualized environment when
 a disk can provisioned with a size larger than its original size.
 In this case, with this package installed, you can automatically use
 the new space without requiring a reboot to re-read the partition table.

Package: cloud-initramfs-rescuevol
Description-md5: bd1aa20bccdfa138c49bcdbb3244b5c9
Description-en: boot off a rescue volume rather than root filesystem
 This package adds functionality to an initramfs built by initramfs-tools.
 When installed the initramfs will check to see if any partitions
 with a label of 'RESCUE_VOL' are attached.  If such a volume is attached,
 it will boot off that volume rather than the root volume.
 .
 This is useful in a cloud environment, when the user is able to attach
 and detach volumes to a running system, but has no other mechanism
 for interupting of fixing a failed boot.  It is analogous to inserting
 a rescue CD into a system to recover from failure.

 .
 The implementation fully supports UDP, TCP, TLS, and DTLS as protocols between
 the TURN client and the TURN server. Both UDP and TCP relaying are supported.
 .
 SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Redis are supported for the user
 repository (if authentication is required).
 The long-term credentials mechanism is supported.
 For WebRTC applications,
 the TURN server REST API for time-limited
 secret-based authentication is implemented.
 The third-party authentication
 specs (OAuth-based) are supported, too.
 .
 Load balancing can be implemented either by DNS round-robin mechanism, or with
 the external networking tools, or by
 the built-in ALTERNATE-SERVER mechanism.
 .
 The implementation is intended to be simple to install and configure.
 The project focuses on performance, scalability, and simplicity.
 The aim is to provide an enterprise-grade TURN solution.

Package: ctdb
Description-md5: 83dff66615250b53a0cd3df6fb3b9ea7
Description-en: clustered database to store temporary data
 CTDB is a cluster implementation of the TDB database used by Samba and other
 projects to store temporary data. If an application is already using TDB for
 temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware
 and use CTDB instead.
 .
 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,
 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Package: dh-modaliases
Description-md5: 1a811f1261ebf8d94f48be93de246b96
Description-en: debhelper extension for scanning kernel module aliases
 dh_modaliases is useful for packages that ship third-party kernel modules,
 either in binary form, or as sources (with e. g. DKMS). It extracts the
 modules' modaliases from either the compile .ko files themselves (for packages
 which ship them in compiled form, using modinfo), or from a package file
 debian/packagename.modaliases.
 .
 This enables software which is looking for missing driver packages (such as
 Jockey or the operating system installer) to identify which package(s) will
 provide a driver for a piece of hardware, identified by its modalias.

 .
  * Try to build a current PO template.
 .
  * Remove inline translations from *.desktop, *.server, *.schemas, and
    *.policy files and replace them with a link to the gettext domain, so that
    strings in them will get translated at runtime from *.mo files. This allows
    language packs to ship updated translations.

Package: flatpak
Description-md5: f91acb1d2880527b2759bc5e2d99fbff
Description-en: Application deployment framework for desktop apps
 Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
 Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
 containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
 to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
 via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
 example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
 sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.
 .
 Each application uses a specified "runtime", or set of libraries, which is
 available as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application
 bundles with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within
 the same desktop environment.
 .
 This package contains the services and executables needed to install and
 launch sandboxed applications, and the portal services needed to provide
 limited access to resources outside the sandbox.

Package: ges1.0-tools
Description-md5: c59e8d2cae5d7d4114d74760a82cde3f
Description-en: Tools for use with the GStreamer editing services
 The GStreamer multimedia framework and the accompanying NLE set of
 plugins for non-linear editing offer all the building blocks for:
 * Decoding and encoding to a wide variety of formats, through all the
   available GStreamer plugins.
 * Easily choosing segments of streams and arranging them through time
   through the NLE set of plugins.
 But all those building blocks only offer stream-level access, which
 results in developers who want to write non-linear editors to write a
 consequent amount of code to get to the level of non-linear editing
 notions which are closer and more meaningful for the end-user
 (and therefore the application).
 .
 The GStreamer Editing Services (GES) aims to fill the gap between
 GStreamer/NLE and the application developer by offering a series
 of classes to simplify the creation of many kind of editing-related
 applications.
 .
 This package contains command-line tools for GStreamer editing
 services.

 * Decoding and encoding to a wide variety of formats, through all the
   available GStreamer plugins.
 * Easily choosing segments of streams and arranging them through time
   through the NLE set of plugins.
 But all those building blocks only offer stream-level access, which
 results in developers who want to write non-linear editors to write a
 consequent amount of code to get to the level of non-linear editing
 notions which are closer and more meaningful for the end-user
 (and therefore the application).

 the Linux kernel.  Android and ChromeOS are two well known examples,
 but there are many other platforms that this will work for, like
 embedded Linux OSes.  This gpgv in combination with debootstrap and
 the Debian archive keyring allows the secure creation of chroot
 installs on these platforms by using the full Debian signature
 verification that is present in all official Debian mirrors.

Package: hedgewars
Description-md5: 95a283ed5766101c57cbbde0d1b67a66
Description-en: Funny turn-based artillery game, featuring fighting hedgehogs!
 Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the
 course of the game, players take turns with one of their
 hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are
 available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby
 winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a
 variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by
 using particular tools such as the "Rope" or "Parachute", to
 move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited
 to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive
 thinking or moving.
 .
 A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players
 during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Homing Bee,
 Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine,
 Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause
 explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks.
 The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a
 restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when
 it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or
 through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either
 side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from
 contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the
 attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player's or CPU turn is
 shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased).

 This application is a command line interface to the LastPass.com services. It
 brings both better security and convenience by allowing you to access, add,
 modify, and delete entries in your online LastPass vault, all from the
 terminal. You can also generate passwords for every server you use and
 securely store those passwords directly in LastPass. LastPass Enterprise
 features are supported as well, including Shared Folders.
 .
 Users who prefer the command line can access their data directly with “lpass
 ls” then using “lpass show -c --password Sitename” to put the Sitename
 password on the copy buffer. You can utilize “lpass show” to store passwords
 used in scripts, rather than putting passwords in the scripts themselves.
 LastPass can also be used as you work within the command line to help you
 login to servers. We’ve included some example scripts below.
 .
 The new tool is beneficial for LastPass users who want to use the command
 line to login to other machines as they work. There are examples such as
 contrib/examples/change-ssh-password.sh which shows automated password
 changing on a server. You could run it automatically on a nightly basis,
 regularly changing the password on the server as a security measure.

Description-en: Event based transparent Client/Server RPC framework
 Event::RPC supports you in developing Event based networking client/server
 applications with transparent object/method access from the client to the
 server. Network communication is optionally encrypted using IO::Socket::SSL.
 Several event loop managers are supported due to an extensible API. Currently
 Event, Glib and AnyEvent are implemented.
 .
 Event::RPC consists of a server and a client library. The server exports a
 list of classes and methods, which are allowed to be called over the network.
 More specific it acts as a proxy for objects created on the server side (on
 demand of the connected clients) which handles client side methods calls with
 transport of method arguments and return values.

Package: libfuzzer-7-dev
Description-md5: bc55cd127b8dab148b78e61e5e475b8e
Description-en: Library for coverage-guided fuzz testing
 LibFuzzer is a library for in-process, coverage-guided, evolutionary fuzzing
 of other libraries.
 .
 LibFuzzer is similar in concept to American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), but it performs
 all of its fuzzing inside a single process. This in-process fuzzing can be
 more restrictive and fragile, but is potentially much faster as there is no
 overhead for process start-up.
 .
 The fuzzer is linked with the library under test, and feeds fuzzed inputs to
 the library via a specific fuzzing entrypoint (aka 'target function'); the
 fuzzer then tracks which areas of the code are reached, and generates mutations
 on the corpus of input data in order to maximize the code coverage. The code
 coverage information for libFuzzer is provided by LLVM's SanitizerCoverage
 instrumentation.

Package: librpmem1-debug
Description-md5: 9cb6d719929810a666621bead2deacf5
Description-en: Persistent Memory remote access support library - debug build
 librpmem provides low-level support for remote access to persistent memory
 (pmem) utilizing RDMA-capable RNICs. The library can be used to replicate
 remotely a memory region over RDMA protocol. It utilizes appropriate
 persistency mechanism based on remote node’s platform capabilities. The
 librpmem utilizes the ssh client to authenticate a user on remote node and for
 encryption of connection’s out-of-band configuration data.
 .
 This library is for applications that use remote persistent memory directly,
 without the help of any library-supplied transactions or memory allocation.
 Higher-level libraries that build on libpmem are available and are recommended
 for most applications.
 .
 This package contains a special build of this library meant for debugging
 purposes. It contains extra logging, assertions and expensive checks that
 should not be used otherwise.

Description-en: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - development files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").

Package: llvm-7
Description-md5: e971ae25bca86cd8f4914ecf62f6301c
Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X86, SparcV9, PowerPC or many other architectures.

Description-md5: b9824fd7fa1117c50a721069422237ef
Description-en: distributed virtual object store - common files
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides some core binaries and clients to control swift.

 manipulating raw images from digital cameras. It can be used as a
 stand-alone tool or as a Gimp plug-in, and images can be batch
 processed using the command-line interface. UFRaw reads most existing
 raw formats using Dave Coffin's raw conversion utility DCRaw, and it
 supports basic color management using Little CMS, allowing the user to
 apply color profiles.

Package: umview-mod-umfuseext2
Description-md5: b5d8ceb3db3bac79e8d6460aa389753f
Description-en: View-OS in user space - ext2 module for UMFUSE
 View-OS is a novel approach to the process/kernel interface.  The semantics of
 each system call can be assigned process by process giving the user the right
 to decide which view of the system each process has to join.  Each process can
 "see" a different file system structure, networking resources, processor,
 devices.  Moreover some of the resources can be provided by the user
 him/herself, thus these resource can be private to the single process and are
 not known a priori by the system.  Groups of processes can share the same view
 but this is just an optimization to share management methods.
 .
 For more information, see http://wiki.virtualsquare.org
 .
 UMView is a user-mode implementation of View-OS.  Processes are run with a
 controlling daemon that captures all the system calls (at present using the
 ptrace() system call) and uses dynamically loadable modules to change their
 semantic.
 .
 This package contains a sub-module for umfuse.  umfuse is contained in the
 main UMView package and allows almost complete source compatibility with FUSE
 modules.  umfuseext2 can be used to mount Extended 2 file system images
 inside an UMView instance.

  * Dragging through short touching and holding down the finger on the touchpad
  * Middle and right button events on the upper and lower corner of the touchpad
  * Vertical scrolling (button four and five events) through moving the finger
    on the right side of the touchpad
  * The up/down button sends button four/five events
  * Horizontal scrolling (button six and seven events) through moving the finger
    on the lower side of the touchpad
  * The multi-buttons send button four/five events, and six/seven events for
    horizontal scrolling
  * Adjustable finger detection
  * Multifinger taps: two finger for middle button and three finger for right
    button events. (Needs hardware support. Not all models implement this
    feature.)
  * Run-time configuration using shared memory. This means you can change
    parameter settings without restarting the X server (see synclient(1)).
  * It also provides a daemon to disable touchpad while typing at the keyboard
    and thus avoid unwanted mouse movements (see syndaemon(1)).

Description-md5: 1cd5b85acd06c23d376b7b5a7f30a0b8
Description-en: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.
 .
