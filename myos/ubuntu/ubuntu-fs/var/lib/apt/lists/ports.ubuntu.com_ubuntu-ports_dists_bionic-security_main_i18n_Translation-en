Package: clamav
Description-md5: fb7be82d5591a0f3facf827f0a60c5d6
Description-en: anti-virus utility for Unix - command-line interface
 Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for Unix. The main purpose of
 this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
 scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable
 multi-threaded daemon in the clamav-daemon package, a command-line
 scanner in the clamav package, and a tool for automatic updating via
 the Internet in the clamav-freshclam package. The programs are based
 on libclamav, which can be used by other software.
 .
 This package contains the command line interface. Features:
  - built-in support for various archive formats, including Zip, Tar,
    Gzip, Bzip2, OLE2, Cabinet, CHM, BinHex, SIS and others;
  - built-in support for almost all mail file formats;
  - built-in support for ELF executables and Portable Executable files
    compressed with UPX, FSG, Petite, NsPack, wwpack32, MEW, Upack and
    obfuscated with SUE, Y0da Cryptor and others;
  - built-in support for popular document formats including Microsoft
    Office and Mac Office files, HTML, RTF and PDF.
 .
 For scanning to work, a virus database is needed. There are two options
 for getting it:
  - clamav-freshclam: updates the database from Internet. This is
    recommended with Internet access.
  - clamav-data: for users without Internet access. The package is
    not updated once installed. The clamav-getfiles package allows
    creating custom packages from an Internet-connected computer.

 set of features, while preserving its interface as simple and easy as possible.
 .
 The main two advantages over other ftp clients are reliability and ability
 to perform tasks in background. It will reconnect and reget the file being
 transferred if the connection broke. You can start a transfer in background
 and continue browsing on the ftp site. It does this all in one process. When
 you have started background jobs and feel you are done, you can just exit
 lftp and it automatically moves to nohup mode and completes the transfers.
 It has also such nice features as reput and mirror. It can also download a
 file as soon as possible by using several connections at the same time.
 .
 Lftp can also be scriptable, it can be used to mirror sites, it lets you
 copy files among remote servers (even between FTP and HTTP). It has an
 extensive online help. It supports bookmarks, and connecting to several

Description-md5: b515da5159368013f8217bb971076081
Description-en: HTTP library implementation in C -- GNOME support library
 It was originally part of a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
 implementation called Soup, but the SOAP and non-SOAP parts have now been
 split into separate packages.
 .
 libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+
 applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers
 on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to
 the GTK+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also
 supported for those who want it).
 .
 The GNOME support library is used for features which are important to
 GNOME apps, but which require GNOME-specific libraries that non-GNOME
 apps may not want to add dependencies on.
 .
 Features:
  * Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs
  * Automatically caches connections
  * SSL Support using GnuTLS
  * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling
  * Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication
  * Server support for Digest and Basic authentication
  * Basic client-side SOAP and XML-RPC support

 implementation of important portions of the Windows API. Just like FreeRDP,
 WinPR is released under the Apache license. Unlike Wine, WinPR does not provide
 binary compatibility, and does not require applications to be built for
 Windows. Instead, WinPR provides API compatibility for applications targeting
 non-Windows environments. When on Windows, the original native API is being
 used instead of the equivalent WinPR implementation, without having to modify
 the code using it.
 .
 This package contains the WinPR development files.

Description-en: library for converting fonts to WOFF 2.0 - development files
 woff2 is a library for converting fonts from the TTF format to the WOFF 2.0
 format. The library also allows decompression from WOFF 2.0 to TTF.
 .
 The WOFF 2.0 format uses the Brotli compression algorithm to compress fonts
 suitable for use in CSS @font-face rules. WOFF 2.0 is a W3C Candidate
 Recommendation.

 If you wish to use this package to create a custom Linux kernel, then it
 is suggested that you investigate the package kernel-package, which has
 been designed to ease the task of creating kernel image packages.
 .
 If you are simply trying to build third-party modules for your kernel,
 you do not want this package. Install the appropriate linux-headers
 package instead.

 NetworkManager is a system network service that manages your network devices
 and connections, attempting to keep active network connectivity when
 available. It manages ethernet, WiFi, mobile broadband (WWAN), and PPPoE
 devices, and provides VPN integration with a variety of different VPN
 services.
 .

Package: wget
Description-md5: 63a4a740bcd9e8e94bf661e4f1806e02
Description-en: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description-en: Windows Portable Runtime library command line utilities
 WinPR is a spin-off project of FreeRDP which aims at providing a portable
 implementation of important portions of the Windows API. Just like FreeRDP,
 WinPR is released under the Apache license. Unlike Wine, WinPR does not provide
 binary compatibility, and does not require applications to be built for
 Windows. Instead, WinPR provides API compatibility for applications targeting
 non-Windows environments. When on Windows, the original native API is being
 used instead of the equivalent WinPR implementation, without having to modify
 the code using it.
 .
 This package contains WinPR command line utils (winpr-hash, winpr-makecert).
